# Kaon

Kaon is a utility to help you use UEVR on Linux.

## Building and running

You'll need Qt 6.8 installed to build Kaon.

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/LorenDB/kaon.git
cd kaon
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .

./src/kaon
```

You can also just open CMakeLists.txt as a project in Qt Creator and press Ctrl+R to run the project.
